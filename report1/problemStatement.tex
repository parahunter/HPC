From the assignment we were given the following tasks

\begin{itemize}
\item Write a function that performs matrix matrix multiplication on arbitrary sized two-dimensional arrays.
\item Make a separate implementation for each way the loops in the above function can be ordered and test which one is the fastest.
\item Compare the result of our implementation to DGEMM(), a similar function in the BLAS library
\item All the functions and the call to DGEMM() should be wrapped into a single library.
\item Implement a blocked version of the matrix matrix multiplication function and identify the block size that gives the best performance in regards to L1 cache. This result should be compared to the timings for the library function.
\item Compare different compiler settings to see how they affect the result.

\end{itemize}
